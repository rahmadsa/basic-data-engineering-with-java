# java programming for basic data engineering

Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of big data collection using java programming. For all the work that data scientists do to answer questions using large sets of information, there have to be mechanisms for collecting and validating that information. In order for that work to ultimately have any value, there also have to be mechanisms for applying it to real-world operations in some way. Those are both engineering tasks: the application of science to practical, functioning systems.

Data engineers focus on the applications and harvesting of big data.
